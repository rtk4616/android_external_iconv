Compiling for the Android Platform
----------------------------------

Android.mk - Build file for the AOSP Platform using the old "make" based build system
Android.bp - Build file for the AOSP Platform using the new "ninja" based build system

The ninja based build system ( soong ) is used on the master branch where as the make
based build system is used on all branches upto and including android-6.0.1

You probably don't want to use libiconv on android in a production environment.
